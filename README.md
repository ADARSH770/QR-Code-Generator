# QR-Code-Generator
Created a QR code generator to search any text or url using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It uses an API to generate a QR code based on the given input.
By scanning the QR code the user will be redirected to the link embedded in the OR code.
I hosted this project using Github Actions.
